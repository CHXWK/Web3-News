# Web3-News
Twitter is one of the main platforms to get Web3 information. With new projects popping up all the time I have crated an application where you can view a stream of tweets about Web3 in real time.

# Usage
Go to https://developers.twitter.com portal and get a bearer token and add it to a .env file\
npm run dev - to run both backend and front end applications
